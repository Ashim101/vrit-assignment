Animated Design

How to Run

Clone the project:
git clone https://github.com/Ashim101/vrit-assignment.git

Go into the project folder:
cd <project_directory>


Install the necessary packages:
npm install


Start the app:
npm run dev


Tools used


Framer Motion: I picked Framer Motion because it's great for creating cool animations, although I found it a bit complex at first. It allowed me to create more dynamic and engaging interactions.

TypeScript: I used TypeScript to make the code safer and to help catch errors while writing it, which made things easier to manage.
Tailwind CSS: I chose Tailwind CSS for styling because it's quick and easy to use. It allowed me to style components directly in my HTML without writing lots of CSS files.


Issues and Limitations


There are still some problems with the animations, especially with the smoothness. I was trying to add a "bounce" effect where the component rotates back slightly before moving forward, but I couldn't quite get it right. Even though I spent a lot of time learning Framer Motion and testing different things, it’s still missing.

Future Improvements


Better Animations: I plan to improve the animations by making them smoother and adding the missing "bounce" effect. I think with more practice, I can fix these issues.

Optimize Performance: I’ll also look into making the app run better on different devices by tweaking the animation logic.

Time Spent
It took me around 8-10 hours to complete this project. Since I’m new to Framer Motion, I had to spend a good amount of time learning how to use it and trying different things. It was challenging, but I learned a lot along the way.
